       <p> Writing short paragraphs teaches children to structure the essay articulately. Use simple words and short sentences while writing a paragraph for generic topics like the Taj Mahal. Also, take note of the arrangement of sentences. Here is an example of a few lines about the Taj Mahal for children:

        Taj Mahal is one of the most adored monuments in the world. The glazing white marble shimmers over the Yamuna river, creating a paradise illusion. In front of the Taj Mahal are lush Persian gardens that complement the majesty of the architecture. The beautiful monument is located in Agra, Uttar Pradesh. Every year, thousands of tourists visit India to take a look at this marvellous piece of architecture.
        
        Taj Mahal is the symbol of love as it was built by Shah Jahan in the memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The grave of Mumtaz lies beneath the Taj Mahal. Today, the monument’s beauty is in danger because of environmental pollution, and this has led to the decolouring of white marble. Hence, the Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ) Authority has banned the use of petrol and diesel vehicles to enter a 500m radius of the Taj Mahal.  <br><br><br>
